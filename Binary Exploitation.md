## Simple Format (125 pts)
> I seem to have forgotten my flag ... Can you guess it for me? I get pretty forgetful of what I type so I made sure to always remind myself if I make a mistake so I don't send the same data twice.
> 
> The service is located at `host1.metaproblems.com 5470`. You can use a tool like `nc` or `netcat` to access it.
> 
> Here's the [compiled binary](https://metaproblems.com/f632e5ca07b55b84f0bd5edc7ffb2201/fundamentals).
> 
> Hint: %s is a useful format indeed, but are there other ways to display data as well?

## Tic Tac Toe (200 pts)
> I made this super impressive Tic Tac Toe application; it will tell you who won a match. Don't you think that is amazing? I'm hosting it at `host.cg21.metaproblems.com` on port `3120` if you want to test it out. Here I'll even give you the [source code](https://metaproblems.com/72b84b6397976c35b967e991afa1f738/tic_tac_toe_Release.tar.gz) to try it out yourself if you would like!

> No brute force is needed, the solution should work everytime!
