## Sugar, We're Goin Up (125 pts)
> In September 2021, GitLab upgraded the CVSSv3 score for a critical remote code execution vulnerability to 10.0, the highest possible score. Although a patch was released in April, numerous public-facing, unpatched GitLab instances remain vulnerable.
> 
> What is the CVE number for this critical, actively exploited vulnerability? The flag format will be `CVE-XXXX-XXXX`.

## The Best Laid Plans... (200 pts)
> Sometimes, routers can break packets up into fragments to meet abnormal networking requirements, and the endpoint will be responsible for putting these back together. Sometimes however, this doesn't go as planned, as Microsoft found out with CVE-2021-24074. We'd like to see the function responsible for this vulnerability, but we're having some trouble finding its name... Could you see if you could find it?

## Who Broke the Printer This Time? (200 pts)
> Malicious operators typically exploit unpatched vulnerabilities within target environments to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and more.
> 
> What recent vulnerability have Conti ransomware operators exploited to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges?
> 
> The flag format will be `CVE-xxxx-xxxxx`

## Who owns the cloud? (225 pts)
> In conducting Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), we act as sort of "cyber detectives," finding little tidbits of information and connecting them to put together a more complete understanding of something.
> 
> Take [this datacenter](https://goo.gl/maps/jacryehbW6NCgD9d9) for example. Usually it is very easy to figure out what company owns a building - especially when it's a giant facility and the company puts their logo on it. But what if the obvious visual clues aren't there? Dig deeper and see if you can find the company that *directly* owns this piece of land. You'll want to submit the name of the company as the flag.

## I want my files back! (275 pts)
> While the world continues to battle COVID-19, the digital world continues to battle its own epidemic - ransomware. Criminals continue to hold organizations' files hostage as they cast a wide net hacking anyone with a vulnerable device or through phishing.
> 
> Fortunately criminals aren't always the sharpest tool in the shed, and sometimes it's possible to decrypt a ransomwared file without paying the ransom. We've come across [one such file](https://metaproblems.com/a813fc7a6085f695ddb6ae1fd7658943/supercriticalfile.png.[AA4-MX4-GGQD]) - perhaps you can figure out what Ransomware strain encrypted it and a way to decrypt it?
> 
> There have been problems with downloading the entire file on Firefox, the md5sum of the file is `32cbeca49de4e1b297550f4ae95a39b6`

## The Searcher (275 pts)
> Alright analyst. We need your help with some investigative work as we dive deeper into one of the infections on our company's network. We've taken [a small packet capture](https://metaproblems.com/2bbaba9a4c07fd6e69cd31f0bd5b5312/the_searcher.pcapng) that we know contains some C2 traffic. In order to give us some more leads for the investigation though, we'd like to see if we can identify what C2 framework the attacker was using. This will give us some leads into potential host-based artifacts that might be left behind.
> 
> Please submit the name of the C2 Framework being used in the form of `MetaCTF{c2frameworkname}`

## Where in the World? (325 pts)
> I must say, every time I see one of these directional signs, I think I've got to make this into a CTF problem. It's the idea of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) or Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT). The idea of being able to take an image and use all of the clues within it to infer details such as where it's at or what's happening in the photo.
> 
> Here is [one such picture](https://metaproblems.com/a7b51e5b1708e4eb6d1722795547b152/sign_of_cities.png) of those signs. Your goal? Use those little details to find the name of the marina it's at which you'll submit for the flag (so `MetaCTF{name of marina}`)

## Mystery C2 Server (350 pts)
> There is a C2 server running an HTTPS listener at `50.17.89.130:1337` can you determine what C2 framework it is? The flag is the name of the C2 framework.<br>
> Example: `MetaCTF{Cobalt Strike}`
> 
> Careful--you only have 10 attempts for this one.

## Where's Vedder? (525 pts)
> Please help find our dear friend Vedder Casyn. His last known location was [this location](https://metaproblems.com/f7ded7cf8ebd4fd47e2311ec1bee293f/location.jpg). We believe it's within a public forest area in his home state.
> 
> The answer should represent the MD5 hash of the address of the location. For example, if the address is: "150 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10006" then the flag will be `e8244cb2f4d53117e9797af909123e86`. Make sure to have the address format the same as above.
> 
> [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoqWbpZUOSo) is helpful for thinking about the right way.

## Online Presence (550 pts)
> Sources say Vedder may have used Reddit the past two weeks. It would make sense for him to post some comments on some major subreddits related to his main career interests or near his local area. Can you help find his account?
> 
> The answer format is the username followed by the post ID and comment ID in the URL to their shortest comment, underscore delimited. For example, for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/r5mmdj/comment/hmnszk4/), the answer would be `MetaCTF{Specialistimran_r5mmdj_hmnszk4}`.
> 
> Hint: There's a logical way to solve this challenge that doesn't require much time. There are two major (both have 500k+ subscribers) work-related subreddits.

## They call me TracerT (550 pts)
> One of the things I find fascinating is the sheer amount of information that $random_devices expose to the network, all without authentication. For example, take Windows RPC. Did you know that you can even sometimes determine if an AV is running on a remote host, all based on unauthenticated querying against RPC?
> 
> On a related note, we, ummmm, accidentally exposed a Cisco Catalyst switch to the internet in its default configuration (minus disabling ports that are unrelated to solving this problem). It's located at `tracert.cg21.mctf.io`. The flag is the hostname of the switch. Good luck :)

## New Spot (600 pts)
> We are looking for where Vedder might frequently visit these days. He may like visiting a regular event that's free in his area hosted by a friend that is about his primary career interests. I'm not sure where he might say he hangs out at now, but it seems everyone has a finsta these days...
> 
> Hint: recommend also checking the app for the later part as there may be inconsistencies in the data displayed between the app and the website.
> 
> The answer should represent the MD5 hash of the address of the location. For example, if the address is: "150 Greenwich St, New York, NY 10006" then the flag will be `e8244cb2f4d53117e9797af909123e86`. Make sure to have the address format the same as above.
