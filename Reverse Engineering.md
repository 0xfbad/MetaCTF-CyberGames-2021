## There Are No Strings on Me (100 pts)
> We've got this program that's supposed to check a password, and we're not quite sure how it works. Could you take a look at it and see about finding the password it's looking for?

## Far From The Weakest Shell (275 pts)
> We've recovered a [weird looking powershell script](https://metaproblems.com/316ff65c92665c96b2c0987bed33eaba/script.7z). Could you take a look at it for us and see if you can figure out how to make it work? It keeps mentioning something about a "flag"; maybe you can get something out of it...

## Source Code Shipping (275 pts)
> Ever wondered what was in those absolutely massive desktop apps such as Slack, Discord, and other apps built using Electron JS? Well we've created [a small Electron-based app](https://metaproblems.com/8f51bf10edf47bdf321e157fc52236f0/Setup.exe) with a flag embedded in its source code for your perusal.
> 
> You don't need to install or run the app to get the flag.

## Getting Darryl Back (350 pts)
> Dread Pirate Darryl has no qualms with a little bit - or a lot - of thievery, as you recently found out to your detriment. Suffice it to say his loot stash has grown quite a bit, and you find yourself down a whole bunch of valuables. This is, put simply, unacceptable. You need to rectify this situation, and returning the favor ought to do the trick.
> 
> As a Dread Pirate, Dread Pirate Darryl has much better things to do than remembering all of his secrets, such as raiding other innocent CTF-goers or shouting "ARRRRR" at the top of his lungs repeatedly. Darryl commissioned a secret vault program to be written for him so that when he needs to take newly acquired loot back to his lair, he can ask it where he has to go.
> 
> Unfortunately for Dread Pirate Darryl, the developer from whom he commissioned the vault was very proud of his work and wanted to show it off, and we here at MetaCTF have acquired a [copy of it](https://metaproblems.com/b30edbbfbee0430b9dc7aab4b9b4e463/darryl_vault). Find Dread Pirate Darryl's treasures! Enact your revenge!
> 
> Note: The flag is the password used to access the location of Dread Pirate Darryl's treasure.
